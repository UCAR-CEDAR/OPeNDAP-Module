Commads added by and notes for the Cedar OPeNDAP server:
<UL>
    <LI>
	get info|flat|tab|stream for <definition_name>;
	<UL>
	    <LI>info: extra documentation related to the data set. info is equivalent to the header records and catalog records</LI>
	    <LI>flat: request for the data stream as a flat file</LI>
	    <LI>tab: request for the data stream as a tab base file</LI>
	    <LI>stream: request the file content as is</LI>

    <LI>Notes:
    <UL>
    When the access to data is restricted, users must first get authenticated
    into the web server. In some cases this access is performed through a
    proxy which is supplying the login for the authentication. For this
    cases, it is possible for the proxy to sign on behalf of whom is
    requesting the data. This is done by using the server side function
    "signature (string s)" where the variable 's' is the login for the
    person using the proxy. The variable s can not contain spaces and in
    general it must follow of the rules for valid logins in a computer
    system.

    Constraint expressions:
    <UL>
	To create a constraint expression this server offers the following
	server side functions:
	<OL STYLE="alpha">
	    <LI>date(BEGIN_year,BEGIN_date,BEGIN_hour_min,
	    BEGIN_centisecond,END_year,END_date,END_hour_min,
	    END_centisecond)</LI>
	    <UL>
		The 8 parameters expose above are REQUIRED. This function
		is used to let the server know that any data record whose
		date is in the range [BEGIN, END] must be returned.
	    </UL>
	    <LI>record_type(kinst(0)/kindat(0),kinst(1)/kindat(1),...,
	    kinst(n)/kindat(n)</LI>
	    <UL>
		This function can take n parameters. The parameters are a
		kinst-kindat combination which defines a record type.
		Repeated record types are not accepted. A kinst value is
		a unique positive integer that defines an instrument, a
		kindat values is a positive integer defined by the
		institution that manages the instrument.
	    </UL>
	    <LI>parameters(p1,p2,p3,...,pn)</LI>
	    <UL>
		This function can take n parameters where each parameter is
		a "CEDAR define parameter" (i.e 54 Magnetic local time) A
		parameter is an integer number. Please notice that is
		possible to request this function like this: parameters().
		In this case no data is returned, just the prologues for
		the data records.
	    </UL>
	</OL>
	<BR />
	Constraint expressions are only analized when you request either
	dds,asc,dods,info or tab. For other actions the constraint
	expression is ignored, this allow you, for example, to modified
	the "ce" while reading the das which contains all the information
	you need to fill record_type(...) or parameters(...)
	<BR />
	<BR />
	Server side functions are "independent" among them, this means
	that you may request all of them or none of them or only one or
	any couple combination. In case that more than one server side
	functions are present each data record should satisfy ALL of the
	constraints in order to be returned.
