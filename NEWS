Version 2.3.3

Up to date with libdap 3.11.x and bes 3.9.x

Updated storage container to find Madrigal data. This data is found in a
different base directory than the cedar data, but is still all in a
single directory (not in the madrigal data structure)

Version 2.3.2

Up to date with libdap 3.10.x and bes 3.8.x

Version 2.3.0

Kinst and parameter information is now retrieved from the database tables
tbl_instrument and tbl_parameter_code.

Re-wrote the database access classes to be more configurable and to be more
like php database access. Data members retreived from a select call can be
accessed from the result set using an overloaded operator->.

Moved user authentication to a new database, now using table cedar_sessions
in mediawiki database rather than tables in CEDARAUTHEN database.

Removed use of AutoPtr classes created for cedar and now using built in C++
autoptr class with vector instances rather than arrays of c types. Using
arrays of c types forced us to create our own class so that the destructor
would use the array delete call.

Upgrading software for use with libdap 3.8.0 and bes 3.6.1

Version 2.1.0

This version of the Cedar handler includes an executable for use with
Server3 and a shared-object library (aka module) for use with Server4. This
is a source release to support the Server4 1.2 beta release and has not been
tested with Server3, although there should be no problems.

This software has been built using gcc 3.2.3 and gcc 4.0.1. It requires the
user of autoconf 2.59 or newer and was built using automake 1.9.6.

The current release of the Cedar software is used as an Apache module and
can be used at cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu.
